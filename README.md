We wrote three different documents in order to keep track of all the important information and modifications that were needed during the software developement:
 - RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
 - DD (Design Document)
 - ITD (Implementation and Testing Document)


# Frameworks & Tools 
The implementation phase was performed using:
 - MySQL for the Database;
 - Java with JAX-RS for building the Restful Server APIs; JPA was exploited for managing the connection with the Database;
 - React-Native (JS) for building the Mobile Application.


# Group Members
This project was developed for the "Data Bases II" course at Politecnico di Milano by me (Ludovico Righi and my colleague Enrico Gherardi.
The final evaluation by our professor was 30/30.
