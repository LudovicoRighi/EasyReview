# Documents
We wrote three different documents in order to keep track of all the important information and modifications that were needed during the software developement:
 - RASD (Requirement Analysis and Specification Document)
 - DD (Design Document)
 - ITD (Implementation and Testing Document)


# Frameworks & Tools 
The implementation phase was performed using:
 - MySQL for the Database;
 - Java with JAX-RS for building the Restful Server APIs; JPA was exploited for managing the connection with the Database;
 - React-Native (JS) for building the Mobile Application.
 
The testing phase of the Application Server was performed using Junit.
